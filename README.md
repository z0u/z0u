I'm an AI researcher and software engineer with a focus on technical alignment research. My background spans data platforms, ML systems, 3D visualization, and computational geometry.

I have always been interested in ethical tech. I have been an avid user of free software since 2000, and have made significant contributions to large open source software projects (most of which is not apparent from my GitHub history). In the 2010s I became a strong advocate of data ethics, and have been focused on AI safety since 2023 ([thanks to Rob Miles](https://www.youtube.com/@RobertMilesAI)).

## Areas of expertise

- AI safety: technical alignment research
- ML engineering and deployment pipelines
- Data platforms with robust governance
- 3D graphics, game development, simulation, computational geometry, visualization
- Web development (full-stack, various frameworks)
- Information retrieval and search systems
- Systems design

Other projects I've worked on (some in deliberately in vague terms):

### AI safety research

- **OOD detection framework**: Developed novel techniques for detecting out-of-distribution inputs in language models.
- **AI bias education tool**: Created an interactive game exploring unintended consequences of AI deployments to help teams identify subtle failure modes.

### Data & ML systems

- **Adaptable ML pipelines**: Built end-to-end ML capabilities including training environments, data pipelines, and serverless inference deployments.
- **Geospatial analysis platform**: Developed a system for performing search and analysis of continent-scale raster and vector data.

### Visualization & graphics

- **3D web experience**: Led development of a highly-usable 3D web app for architectural visualization and design.
- **Interactive simulation tools**: Created novel solvers for 3D engineering simulations with real-time interactive visualizations.
- **3D adventure game**: Built a unique game featuring innovative physics for character movement and environment interaction.
